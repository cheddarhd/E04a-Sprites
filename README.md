# E04a-Sprites Exercise

This excercise is cool as I can think of different possibilities that this can be used. Learned more about python functions in regards to images and learned a litle more about arcade. Excited too see whats next.

 * main4.pyâ€”*extra credit*:
   * Find some other sprites, and make them into a collage
   * Using what you have learned in the other exercise files, draw at least ten sprites in the window
   * [kenney.nl](https://kenney.nl) or [openGameArt.org](https://opengameart.org) are resources for free images
   * If you would like to make them move or react to the mouse, I will award extra points
